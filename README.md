# Stereonet-and-Roset-Plot
In Hydropower Projects based in Nepal/Himalyan, sbusurface investigation is realtively less and if available need to be used with caution as rock is anisotrpic in nature.
Thus many interpretation and analysis is required from the surface and subsurface data available. One of the main and crucial data is geological mapping of the area. 
With the mappping data, the alignment and sizing of underground structures and position can be optiimsed. Sometimes the the future can be predeicted based on the joint orientation and tunnel alignment.
Thus Roset plot and stereonet is very insturmental through out the project period.
The code used include mplstereonet library (https://pypi.org/project/mplstereonet/), and inspired from the model generated by Geology and Python http://geologyandpython.com/structural_geology.html
